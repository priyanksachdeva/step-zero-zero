## App Configuration

### 1. Version Management

#### Update version in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```gradle
android {
    defaultConfig {
        versionCode 1          // Increment for each release
        versionName "1.0.0"    // Semantic versioning
    }
}
```

#### Update version in `package.json`:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

### 2. App ID and Naming

#### Verify app ID in `capacitor.config.ts`:

```typescript
const config: CapacitorConfig = {
  appId: "com.nothing.health",
  appName: "Nothing Health",
  webDir: "dist",
  bundledWebRuntime: false,
};
```

### 3. App Icon and Splash Screen

#### Generate adaptive icons:

```bash
# Use Android Image Asset Studio in Android Studio
# Or use online generators like:
# - https://romannurik.github.io/AndroidAssetStudio/
# - https://apetools.webprofusion.com/app/#/tools/imagegorilla

# Required sizes:
# - mdpi: 48x48
# - hdpi: 72x72
# - xhdpi: 96x96
# - xxhdpi: 144x144
# - xxxhdpi: 192x192
```

Place icons in appropriate directories:

```
android/app/src/main/res/
├── mipmap-mdpi/ic_launcher.png
├── mipmap-hdpi/ic_launcher.png
├── mipmap-xhdpi/ic_launcher.png
├── mipmap-xxhdpi/ic_launcher.png
├── mipmap-xxxhdpi/ic_launcher.png
└── mipmap-anydpi-v26/
    ├── ic_launcher.xml
    └── ic_launcher_round.xml
```

## Building Release Version

### 1. Generate Upload Keystore

```bash
# Generate new keystore (one-time setup)
keytool -genkey -v -keystore upload-keystore.jks \
    -alias upload \
    -keyalg RSA \
    -keysize 2048 \
    -validity 10000 \
    -storetype JKS

# Enter details:
# - Your name: Nothing Health Team
# - Organization: Your Company
# - City: Your City
# - State: Your State
# - Country: US (or your country code)
```

### 2. Configure Signing

#### Create `android/keystore.properties`:

```properties
storePassword=your_store_password
keyPassword=your_key_password
keyAlias=upload
storeFile=upload-keystore.jks
```

#### Update `android/app/build.gradle`:

```gradle
def keystorePropertiesFile = rootProject.file("keystore.properties")
def keystoreProperties = new Properties()
keystoreProperties.load(new FileInputStream(keystorePropertiesFile))

android {
    signingConfigs {
        release {
            keyAlias keystoreProperties['keyAlias']
            keyPassword keystoreProperties['keyPassword']
            storeFile file(keystoreProperties['storeFile'])
            storePassword keystoreProperties['storePassword']
        }
    }
    buildTypes {
        release {
            signingConfig signingConfigs.release
            minifyEnabled true
            shrinkResources true
            proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android-optimize.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. Build Production App Bundle

```bash
# 1. Clean and build web assets
npm run build

# 2. Sync with Android
npx cap sync android

# 3. Build release AAB
cd android
./gradlew bundleRelease

# Output: android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
```

### 4. Verify Build

```bash
# Check AAB contents
bundletool build-apks --bundle=app-release.aab --output=app.apks

# Test on device
bundletool install-apks --apks=app.apks
```
